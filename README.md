## DESCRIPTION

Has the quarantine got you to your peaks of boredom?
Tired of scrolling on instagram, binge watching, and ludo?

We present you 'TUG OF WAR!' , by Statefully Fidgetting.


It's a unique game where you can not just play with your friends, but play against them.
You can divide your friends group into two teams and compete against each other.
The collection of tailored questions will bring the best of your memories and bonds.
Let's see which group knows it's members best.
And remember!
It's a tug of war. So the moment your opponent does better than you, you lose your points.

There are two options available, 
1. To Host
2. To join

Once the user hosts a gameroom, a unique id will be generated. The user can send an invite via Whatsapp, which is an autogenerated messege. The other memebers can join the game using this id. Teams can be manually created by users and once it is done the game will be started.
There is an option to send invite even after the game has started, enabling users to join later too.


We would also like to create a couple version of the same game, which would be an entertainment app for couples too.



Enjoy your quarantine!!
