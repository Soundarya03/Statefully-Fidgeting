## DESCRIPTION

Has the quarantine got you to your peaks of boredom?
Tired of scrolling on instagram, binge watching, and ludo?

We present you Tug of war , by Statefully Fidgetting.

It's a unique game where you can not just play with your friends, but play against them.
You can divide your friends group into two teams and compete against each other.

Let's see which group knows it's members best

And remember!
It's a tug of war. So the moment your opponent does better than you, you lose your points

Enjoy your quarantine!!
